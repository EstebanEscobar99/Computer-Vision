# OpenCV Fundamentals
 Some exercises from my learning path in the computer vision area

## Where to learn

- [OMES](https://omes-va.com/)
- [Ball Tracking](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/tutorials/computer-vision/)
- [Python Code](https://www.thepythoncode.com/topic/computer-vision?p=1)

### Examples - Color_range_detector.py
 To execute this script, open the terminal and copy the following lines.
 
````commandline
python Color_range_detector.py -f FILTER [-i IMAGE] [-w] [-p]
````

Where FILTER could be either RGB or HSV, IMAGE could be a local file on your local device, -w refers to the webcam and 
-p disables the preview of the mask.
