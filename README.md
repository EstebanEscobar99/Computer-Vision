# OpenCV Fundamentals
 Some exercises from my learning path in the computer vision area

## Examples - Color_range_detector.py
 To execute this script, open the terminal and copy the following lines.
 
````commandline
python Color_range_detector.py -f FILTER [-i IMAGE] [-w] [-p]
````

Where FILTER could be either RGB or HSV, IMAGE could be a local file on your local device, -w refers to the webcam and 
-p disables the preview of the mask.
